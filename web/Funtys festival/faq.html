  				<p class="maininfo">We try to answer all questions as accurately as possible, but we would also like to ask that you check all information on the website and FAQ section before contacting us. This way we can limit the amount of mails in the info mailbox, in order to be able to answer the most essential questions in detail.<br>E-mails containing questions of which the answers can be found on the website will therefor not be answered.</p>

	  			<h4 class="question">Can I work at Tomorrowland, even as a volunteer?</h4>
	  			<div class="answer hidden">
	  				<ul><li>This is not possible. Every year we work with the same suppliers and our own loyal staff. During the production days we do not have the time to train new crew. And to inform you: as a crewmember you won’t be able to enjoy the festival, as you will need to work hard during festival hours. Unfortunately there are currently no vacancies for crewmembers.</li><li>We cannot allow a volunteer to work at our festival, as it is prohibited by Belgian Law. We can only offer work to an existing Association with members older than 18 years and able to work the full 3 days of the festival.</li><li>The acts and dancers are the same team each year and we cannot offer this to other people.</li></ul>	  			</div>
	  			<h4 class="question">Problems with registration? Did you not receive a confirmation mail?</h4>
	  			<div class="answer hidden">
	  				<p>Our apologies for the not receiving the preregistration e-mail. We use a service that prevents blocking the e-mail to most providers. However there still can be a delivery issue for various reasons. In order to solve this we kindly ask you to:<br>- Double check your SPAM, Unwanted or mail Quarantaine folder.<br>- Resubmit the preregistration form and double check the entered e-mail.<br>- If this still doesn’t work, please try to preregister with a gmail or hotmail mailbox. These are known to work well and do not block the preregistration mail.</p>
