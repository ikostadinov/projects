<p><span style="color:white">Bar Calders -</span>For all Pere Calders fans – God has heard your prayers. The cul-de-sac named after the writer has recently become home to one of the loveliest spots in Sant Antoni. They have books by the Catalan author, the draught beer flows freely and there’s a selection of tapas that sends shivers of pleasure through the district. Obviously, the best thing to try is the vermouth. They stock four brands, but if you want to try a Priorat, then you should go for the one from Falset. Incidentally, the outdoor terrace is one of the district’s best kept secrets: You’ll just keep coming back </p>

	<p><span style="color:white">Tinta Roja - </span>A smooth and mysterious bar, once a dairy farm, lent a Buenos Aires bordello/theatre/circus/cabaret vibe by plush red velvet sofas, smoochy niches and an ancient ticket booth. It's an atmospheric place to go for a late-ish drink, and there are tango classes on Wednesday nights. </p>

	<p><span style="color:white">El Bar de l'Antic Teatre - </span> It has that shabby look that is shared by all alternative cultural associations. If what you’re looking for is gorgeous waiters, David Guetta on the deck and Absolut with Red Bull at exorbitant prices, you’d better go to Opium Mar. L'Antic Teatre is an old, recycled space, but has one of the best indoor terraces you’ll ever see. An enormous courtyard with vegetation dotted around haphazardly, ideal for kicking back with a beer or two and waiting for the show to begin. Mourinho could not have been more right: it’s a great place for theatre. </p>
