	<p><span style="color:white">Champs Elysees - </span>Known to the French as 'la plus belle avenue du monde', (the most beautiful avenue in the world), the Champs Elysees is one of the world's most famous thoroughfares. Stretching from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde, it may not be the most exclusive street in the city of lights, but it is the most iconic and the surrounding streets are full of high style bars and cool cocktail joints not to mention the plush hotel lounges that abound in this part of Paris.</p>

	<p><span style="color:white">Opera and Les Halles - </span> Famous for its large shopping precinct, the area of Les Halles has a commercial and buzzing atmosphere. Flashy boutiques and fast food joints crowd the streets, but there is also a decent scattering of diverting places to drink, not to mention the iconic, and unmissable, Pomipidou Centre. Further shopping hotspots can be found in the neighbouring Opera district, alongside the famous Opera Garnier. Here you will find a cluster of Japanese restaurants as well as mixture of well established bars and fashionable newcomers.</p>
