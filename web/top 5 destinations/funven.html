<p><span style="color:white">The silent rowing parade -</span>Last appointment of the Carnival, Tuesday Feb. 2012 with The Silent Rowing Parade, a farewell to the Carnival, taken by a candle light rowing parade along the Grand Canal from Rialto Bridge to Saint Mark's basin.
With gondolas and traditional rowing  boats wrapped into memories of a mysterious Venice, in the complete absence of engine boats, the already precious atmosphere will be enriched on his natural scenery by thousands of lights creating surreal Venice, palaces amongst light and shadows, a magic atmosphere of past epochs, creation of an unique and spectacular moment, suggestive an unrepeatable.

Once the parade get to Punta della Dogana  the Taurus, the symbolic allegory that will be moored for the entire Carnival on Saint Mark's basin will be set on fire with fireworks, a pyrotechnic show greeting 2012 Carnival renewing the appointment for the next year!

	<p><span style="color:white">The Flight of the Angel - </span>The Flight of the Angel is an event usually held on Shrove Thursday of Carnival(grasso) this has its roots due to an event that happened in the mid 16th century. In those years, during various exihibitions, a Turkish acrobat did something that stupefied the Venetians.
With the only aid of a pole he walked on a rope from a boat tied in Riva degli Schiavoni to the top of St Mark's Towerand then from the tower to the Doge's Palace balcony, as a tribute to the doge.

The exihibition changed its name and became "The Flight of the Turk", it has been held every year with various changes, first it was made only by professional acrobats and lately by common people that wanted to show their ability and bravery.

The exihibition name changed into "The Flight of the Angel" when for the first time an acrobat dressed with angel wings tied to a rope was let down the tower, at the end of the descent the doge himself gave the angel impersonator a gift.

The event changed its name again into "Volo della Colombina" ("The Flight of the dove") starting from 1759. In that year the acrobat dressed as the angel fell down over  the horrified crowd.
Since then a wooden dove substitute the men.

After the fall of the Republic the event was banned (as many other traditions) until recent times

	<p><span style="color:white">Masks and Costumes - </span> In the past the mask was, and still is, the essence itself of the Carnival, by wearing masks and costumes it is possible to hide completely an identity with absolutely no reference to sex religion and age, social level or whatsoever. 
This make you behave as use and habit of the impersonate character, a moment of escape from reality and  the platitude of everyday same old life.
This is the reason why the most common salutation in use was "good morning mask".

The use of the mask in Venice start gradually developing from nothing bringing life to a rich activity of production and trade of masks and costumes.
First news of this production are from 1271.  Specific tools where made to work the materials necessary to the mask production process, they were embellished with engraves, paintworks, laces and pearls.
The job of " Mascarer" (Mask Artisan) was officially registered with a special statute in 1946 and still conserved in the state Archive of Venice.
