<p><span style="color:white">Ohla Hotel - </span> The facade of the latest addition to Barcelona's luxury hotel scene is adorned with a thousand eyes on stalks, courtesy of surrealist Catalan designer Frederic Amat. Inside the tone is more sombre, the monochrome chic of the rooms softened only by the oak floors and velvet bed throws. The design details are well thought out, however  finding the hidden toilet can take a moment or two  and the extras a nice surprise: "What scent would you like for your bedlinen, madam?" Michelin-starred chef Xavier Franco has transferred his superb Sauc restaurant to the Barri Gotic, and the crowning glory is the rooftop deck with luxurious daybeds and a glass-sided pool.</p>

	<p><span style="color:white">Casa Camper</span> A kooky venture into the hotel business from the makers of the iconic shoes. In keeping with the boho nature of the surrounding streets of Raval, the design is hip but rather eccentric, from the hammocks slung across the corners of the rooms, to the layout that means that the private sitting rooms are across a corridor from the bedrooms (forget any notions of watching TV in bed). Staff are upbeat and helpful, and downstairs there are piles of books and magazines, along with a free snack bar where guests can help themselves to soup, sandwiches, drinks and so on. Breakfast is (unusually for Spain) included. </p>

	<p><span style="color:white">Chic & Basic </span>is a misnomer Fairly Chic & Fairly Basic would be more accurate but the concept is clear. The entire hotel is decorated in white, and its small rooms employ all sorts of other tricks to appear more spacious, from twisted acrylic room dividers to showers at the foot of the bed (not for the shy). In the Be Yourself lounge you'll find fantastical rococo sofas, free Wi-Fi, a computer for guests and an area where you can help yourself to a range of teas, coffee and biscuits. There is a small gym, but few other facilities a limited breakfast is available in the restaurant downstairs, but there's plenty of places to eat in the Born. </p>
