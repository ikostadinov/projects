<p><span style="color:white">AbaC -</span>Having been through a series of highs and lows (high at its old spot in the Born, low when it moved up town and struggled to entice an audience), ABaC is back on form. This time with Jordi Cruz at the helm, who is credited with being the youngest chef in Spain to earn a Michelin star (he was 25 at the time). The slick, architect-designed interior places it in the realms of the power restaurant – a dramatic black and steel kitchen contrasted by a tranquil, all white dining room with views into the garden. Serious eaters looking for an experimental experience will find there's plenty to get their juices flowing here with innovations such as oysters tartar with fennel, or goat kid with cider foam.</p>

	<p><span style="color:white">Cinc Sentits - </span>When Cinc Sentits opened in May 2004 it fast established itself as one of the top places in town – both in terms of quality and price – to sample modern Catalan cooking from Jordi Artal, a self-taught chef who grew up in Canada, but returned to his roots to open the restaurant in Eixample Esquerra. The minimal decor provides a great frame to his elegant, new wave cooking based on local, mostly organic and wild ingredients. Dishes such as Catalan caviar with smoked sturgeon and poached quail's egg, tomato sorbet with garlic "bubbles", and chocolate mousse with arbequina olive oil ice cream and roast macadamias form the foundation of the oft-changing tasting menu. He picked up a well-deserved Michelin star in November 2008.</p>

	<p><span style="color:white">Koy Shunka - </span> Koy Shunka is a shining example of the newish MediterrAsian genre and indeed the new breed of Asian chefs in the city (particularly Japanese), who take delicate techniques from home and apply them to local products. Ferran Adrià was a vocal admirer of the style and emulated it at El Bulli, but – and I say this in a whisper – chef Hideki Matsuhisa does it better in the Barri Gòtic. The dining room is beautiful, all dark grey slate, polished wood and zen-like vibes, but the best place to sit is at kappo-style counter to watch the masters at work, honing pristine plates of stone-seared prawns and peas, and hake cheek and shiso tempura.</p>
