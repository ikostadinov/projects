<h3 align="center">What to see</h3>
<p><span style="color:white">Ramble down colourful La Rambla - </span> One of the most famous boulevards in the world, La Rambla is worth a stroll down even if you only have one day in Barcelona. A gateway to rural Catalonia, the mile-long road bustles with tourists, artists, human statues, fortune-tellers, dancers and musicians. Vibrant flower stalls, a cultural and exhibition centre, the superb La Boqueria market, a Joan Miro mosaic, newspaper kiosks and cafes line the street. You may pay a fortune to sip a cola at a roadside cafe but the people-watching opportunities will be worth the price.</p>

	<p><span style="color:white">Get up close to Gaudi's grand designs - </span>In Barcelona, you can gaze in wonder at Gaudi's fairytale architecture. The Sagrada Familia is breathtaking and grotesque by turns. At first glance, it seems as though a careless giant has dripped melting wax over a Gothic cathedral, but a closer look reveals that the protuberances create a stone tapestry of Christ's life. Take the lift to the top for a breathtaking view. Park Guell is a magical place that emulates an English garden city. After seeing the gatehouses, based on designs for the opera Hansel and Gretel, you can walk up a splendid staircase, past a mosaic lizard to what once was a marketplace. Outside, climb to the heights of the park to gaze down at the magnificent panorama. And right in the centre of the city you can take a break from shopping and gaze at La Pedrera, a work of art in its own right, which also houses three exhibition spaces. Even the rooftop chimneys are something to marvel at.</p>

	<p><span style="color:white">Revel in the Raval - </span> Like Paris, Barcelona has a literary flavour. In this city, many writers have been inspired by the lower Raval, generally referred to as the Barrio Chino, a name coined by an American journalist due to its underworld feel in the 1920s. Haunted by drifters and prostitutes, the seedy ghetto forms a strangely glamorous setting for Jean Genet's existential novel The Thief's Journal (1949) and provides the backdrop for the civil war novel The Palace (1962) by Nobel prize-winner Claude Simon and The Margin by Andre Pieyre de Mandiargues (1967), which was made into a film. For a bite of tapas, visit Els Tres Tombs, a favourite with the Sunday book market scavengers. You can browse through books at the cosy bar of Cafe de les Delicies and catch a poetry reading at The Quiet Man.</p>
