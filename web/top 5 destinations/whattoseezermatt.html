<h3 align="center">What to see</h3>
<p><span style="color:white">Gornergrat - </span> With the sun shining and the snow laying in perfect, pristine conditions you are likely to have a fabulous train ride up to Gornergrat - a viewing point at 3100m - that looks directly at the Matterhorn and in the other direction to Monte Rosa.

Starting from opposite the main Zermatt rail station you can catch the rack and pinion railway for about a 40 minute ride up the steep mountain slopes to its other terminus at Gornergrat. There are several stops en route where skiers join in order to start once again on their downhill journey with skis or snowboards. The carriages are very much geared to the needs of skiers with areas for skis to be stored but there is plenty of seating as well.</p>

	<p><span style="color:white">St. Mauritius Church - </span>The statuary and fittings of the interior of St Maurizius, are very ornate. When I walked in, my first impression was of GOLD. Everything is heavily gilded and extremely rich looking. It really is quite beautiful. </p>
	<p>The Catholic church is situated in the main town square and dominates the skyline of Zermatt.
 I couldn't find out much about its history, but it was a beautiful both on the inside and out.
I loved hearing the bells ringing from my hotel room two blocks away.</p>

	
	<hr style="width:90%;">
	<p><span style="color:white">Alpine Museum - </span> This is an ideal visit if the weather is bad or if you are taking a break from a nice day of hiking. The museum focuses on several aspects of life in the mountains. It takes into account the geological composition, plant life (especially the wildflowers), some of the native animals, and the stories of some of the famous mountain climbers as they went after the big peaks. Among the exhibits is the ice axe of the first person to climb the Matterhorn. There is an admission charge, although it is free to those with a valid Swiss Pass.</p>
